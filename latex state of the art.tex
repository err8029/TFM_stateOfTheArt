\textbf{\large Cooperative leader following in a distributed multi-robot system}
\end{center}


In this paper they adress the probem of managing a group robots with hetereogeneous capabilities. The first robot navigates by using a predefined pattern or by being teleoperated, whie the other robots follow it. To achieve that, a series of rules are needed, at team and individual level (both levels can be executed in parallel). Those behaviours are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Team - Follow:} every robot follows the local leader
	\item \textbf{Team - Wait:} If an unexpected event happens the group stops
	\item \textbf{Team - Recover:} It is executed to recover from a wait conditiond
	\item \textbf{Robot - Follow:}
	\item \textbf{Robot - Local wait:}
	\item \textbf{Robot - Remote wait:}
	\item \textbf{Robot - Local recover:}
	\item \textbf{Robot - Remote recover:}
\end{itemize}
